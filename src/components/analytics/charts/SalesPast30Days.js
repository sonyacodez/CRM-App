// This chart shows the number of sales for the past 30 days
// The date in the heading and the data should be generated dynamically based on today's date
// You'll have to play with dates a bit to get the X-Axis to display nicely
// We've slightly multiplied our sales with random numbers (1-4) to make the chart look nicer
